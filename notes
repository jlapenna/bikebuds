Before I asked why GAE can't find TensorFlow lib here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40241846/why-googleappengine-gives-me-importerror-no-module-named-tensorflow

And Dmytro Sadovnychyi told me that GAE can't run TensorFlow, but GAE flexible can.

https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/flexible-for-standard-users
The flexible environment is intended to be complementary to the standard
environment. If you have an existing application running in the standard
environment, it’s not usually necessary to migrate the entire application to
the flexible environment. Instead, identify the parts of your application that
require more CPU, more RAM, a specialized third-party library or program, or
that need to perform actions that aren’t possible in the standard environment.
Once you’ve identified these parts of your application, create small App Engine
services that use the flexible environment to handle just those parts. Your
existing service running in the standard environment can call the other
services using HTTP, Cloud Tasks alpha, or Cloud Pub/Sub.  """
